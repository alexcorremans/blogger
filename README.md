# Blogger

This is my version of the [Blogger tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) from Jumpstart Labs, so I could try out [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails)
